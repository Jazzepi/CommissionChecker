Quickstart
1. Unzip everything into a single directory.
2. Configure the checker.properties file with authentication information and what artist you're interested in watching. The checker uses the email information to send you an email notification when it finds a new commission open. You can edit this file with any simple text editor. Notepad will do. Do not use something like Microsoft Word. Set the any sites you want to be checked for commissions to "true".
3. Run the jar by double clicking on it.

Optional
1. You can setup a script to run the commission checker every time you run in by modifying the included .bat file. Point it at your commission-checker.jar and then put the .bat file in your Startup folder. It will run every time you startup windows, with nothing but a system tray icon.
